  * [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.

  * [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with superpowers. Sass boasts more features and abilities than any other CSS extension language out there.

  * [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) Create React App is a tool built by developers at Facebook to help you build React applications. It saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration. You simply run one command and create react app sets up the tools you need to start your React project.
